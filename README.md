We are currently testing out [Jupytext](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
It has been added to Python requirements. You won't see `*.ipynb` files in this
repo, because Jupytext automagically creates them from `*.py` files. This way,
committing and merging changes should cause less headaches as it basically boils
down to merging Python files.

You can also listen to [Marc Wouts short
talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDYdeVfMh48) about it.

However, for students we might want to still create the static `*.ipynb` file.
